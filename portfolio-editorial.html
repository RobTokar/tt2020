                <p>"Editor" can mean a lot of things depending on the field and the medium. In my seven years at Marvel Comics (five in New York, two in Los Angeles under Stan Lee), a comic book editor is the caretaker of the property / characters under their control as well as the project manager for their books. The editor hires the entire creative team (writer(s), penciler(s), inker(s), letterer(s) and colorist(s)), sets and enforces their schedules, approves storylines and artwork and coordinates with design, production, sales, marketing, manufacturing and accounting to help get the comic print-ready, printed and sold.</p>
                <p>In my five years at Tokyopop, editors worked on English Adaptations of manga (comics from Japan) and manhwa (comics from Korea) and also helped to create original manga based on licensed properties (like <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Warcraft</i>) or from entirely new concepts.</p>
                <p>Following is a small selection of my editorial work:</p>

                            <p>Volume 1, issues 194 - 203</p>
                            <p>My mantra on this title was, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it!" J.M. DeMatteis and Sal Buscema made an extraordinary team and I thought that the best thing I could do was to keep them happy and stay out of their way. My favorite example of their collaboration is in the super-sized issue 200. The last few pages the issue are a dramatic, tragic, heartbreaking scene that ended up being entirely silent because when the writer saw the pages, he thought the story was being told so well that it was better without any captions or dialogue. And he was right: it's a powerful scene.</p>

                            <p>Volume 1, issues 107 - 130</p>
                            <p>I loved Alpha Flight as an X-Men fan before AF had their own series and I was a loyal reader when
                                this series was released. When I was told I'd be inheriting the series, I was thrilled even though
                                sales were weak. There are things about this run that I am proud of and things I wish I would have
                                done differently but one decision I am glad I made was to keep the team alive. We had seriously
                                considered killing them all off in the end but I thought it would be too cruel to fans (like myself)
                                who had grown to love these characters. Additionally, Marvel's Executive Editor Mark Gruenwald told
                                me that he regretted killing off so many "lame" villains in his Scourge of the Underworld storyline
                                as even the weakest character has the potential to become interesting in the right hands. With that
                                in mind, I thought it would be best to leave the entire team for potential future use throughout the
                                Marvel Universe. Of course, we had fun scaring the fans with the possibility that we would kill them
                                all and the last three issues featured covers with strong death imagery.</p>

                            <p>These were a lot of work behind the scenes but worth it all. Working on this project introduced me to award-winning fantasy writer Richard Knaak, super-talented artist Jae-Hwan Kim and Blizzard's Sorcerer Supreme Chris Metzen. My work on this title is what got me a gig at Blizzard Entertainment when Tokyopop laid off over half its staff, myself included.</p>

                            <p>I started on this series as an intern to editor Don Daley and assistant editor Kelly Corvese. I was fortunate to work with the Transformers legends Simon Furman, Bob Budiansky, Geoff Senior, Andrew Wildman and Jose Delbo in addition to commissioning covers by John Romita Jr and Bob Layton, Jim Lee, and Bill Sienkiewicz among others. I learned a lot working on this title and it gave me my first taste of licensed publishing with many important lessons on licensing relationships.</p>

                            <p>Created by Ken Akamatsu before he made the hit <i>Love Hina</i> series. As a new editor at Tokyopop, I only worked on the last few volumes of <i>Love Hina</i> though I ended up making revisions to every volume as they were reprinted. I was fortunate enough to get Adam Arnold (who wrote the English Adaptation for <i>Love Hina</i>) to work on this series as well. Adam brought a lot of knowledge, insight respect and creativity to the adapatation and I think it directly contributed to the book's success in the English-reading market.</p>

                            <p>Having edited the last few issues of The Toxic Avenger, I was excited to continue my working relationship with Troma Entertainment by editing the Toxic Crusaders comic.
